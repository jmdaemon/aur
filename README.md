# Arch User Repositories

This repository contains all the Arch User Repository (AUR) packages that I currently maintain.

## Contributing

If a package is broken, or a new release for a package is available, you can contribute by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/jmdaemon/aur/issues).

Alternatively you can also contact me by [email](mailto:josephm.diza@gmail.com).
