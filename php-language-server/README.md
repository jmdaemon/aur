# php-language-server

This PKGBUILD will allow you to install `php-language-server` but please do not do so.

`php-language-server` is around 70MiB when installed and will take at least 5-10 minutes every time you open
up a php file to finish initialization properly. If you are willing to put up with these drawbacks then 
you can use the PKGBUILD here to install it.
